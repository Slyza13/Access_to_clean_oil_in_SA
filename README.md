# 🧪 South Africa: Access to Clean Cooking (2000–2022)

## 🔍 About
This data project visualizes clean fuel access trends in South Africa, with a focus on the disparity between rural and urban populations. Using Power BI and open data from the World Bank, we explore how access has evolved over the last two decades and highlight the inequality in energy access.

## 🗂️ Dataset
**Source:** [World Bank via HDX](https://data.humdata.org/)  
**Indicators Used:**
- Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (% of population)
- Access to clean fuels..., rural (% of rural population)
- Access to clean fuels..., urban (% of urban population)

## 💡 Insights
- Urban access is consistently higher than rural.
- Rural access, though lower, shows a positive trend.
- The energy access gap is closing, but slowly.
